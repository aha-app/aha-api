Ruby wrapper for Aha! API
=========================

This is a very rudimentary wrapper for the Aha! REST API. Currently it is 
incomplete and only provides wrappers for the API calls needed by [aha-services](https://github.com/aha-app/aha-services).

Contact [support@aha.io](mailto:support@aha.io) for help with this API.
